Yep, I'm still in London, which is pretty awesome: P Remind me to post the million and one pictures that I took when I get back to Markham!...
Have to say, I hate Paris Hilton's behavior but I do think she's kinda cute..
i will love the lakers.
I'm so glad I love Paris Hilton, too, or this would be excruciating.
considering most Geico commericals are stupid...
i liked MIT though, esp their little info book(
Before I left Missouri, I thought London was going to be so good and cool and fun and a really great experience and I was really excited.
I still like Tom Cruise.
well, i had a piece of crap toyota celica but it died in portland and i got a ford ranger..
i love angelina jolie.
I still like Tom Cruise.
UCLA is beautiful.
I think Angelina Jolie is so much more beautiful than Jennifer Anniston, who, by the way, is majorly OVERRATED.
Angelina Jolie is beautiful.
and honda's are awesome:).
I love Harvard.
i love tom cruise!..
This means we beat out schools like MIT, which is amazing for a relatively small, unassuming lil'IS department.
i hate london bugs.
Way to go stupid Lakers..
london sucks....
anyway, shanghai is really beautiful ， 滨江大道是很灵的啦 ， 那个starbucks是上海风景最好的starbucks ~ ~!!!

angelina jolie is so beautiful that i don't even have the desire to attain such exquisite beauty..
I reallllllly hate Tom Cruise...
To my understanding, Harvard is a very difficult college to get in to.
Boston can suck my fucking tits...
I loved Boston and MIT so much and still do.
I like honda civics!!!!!!.
no matter how obvious it is to me that George W Bush is an arrogant idiot liar, there are plenty of people who believe him.
I love the Los Angeles Lakers...
the stupid honda lol or a BUG!..
seattle sucks anyways.
I want a ThinkPad or something.
I love Shanghai, it's such a great city, and Hongzhou is only a two hour train ride away from it.
My Purdue Cal friends are awesome!..
Shanghai is beautiful ~..
london sucks....
i love my new Macbook..
i love my new Macbook..
i'd love to see the clips and lakers in the second round, though the winner would just be a stepping stone for the mavs or spurs...
Awesome diner here @ Purdue...
i love my new Macbook..
San Francisco was brilliant, Sausalito...
As for myself, I'm wanting a new Honda Element with a prescription windshield....
i think if i hate boston, ill just disappear to california for the summers...
I love the Toyota Prius.
seattle sucks anyways.
I love Harvard Square in the fall.
I want a tour of London on the back of that bike!
I know you're way too smart and way too cool to let stupid UCLA get to you...
The Lakers are playing really awesome ball.
It isn't over until its over though, and for now my brain is set on " I love Harvard, I want to come to Harvard " mode.....
harvard is dumb, i mean they really have to be stupid to have not wanted her to be at their school.
I'm loving Shanghai > > > ^ _ ^.
harvard is for dumb people.
As i stepped out of my beautiful Toyota, i heard a scream as a gust of wind had just passed.
Bodies being dismembered, blown apart, and mutilated in any number of ways, or Angelina Jolie sucking a dick on a 30 foot screen?..
I love Harvard Square in the fall.
London = amazing...
I HATE LONDON!..
I love MIT so much...
I told her that UCLA is excellent for both...
I think at this moment i love San Francisco better than L. A..
I think Angelina Jolie is so much more beautiful than Jennifer Anniston, who, by the way, is majorly OVERRATED.
I also love Boston Legal...
the stupid honda lol or a BUG!..
Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
i've decided i really miss london.
Prolly going to Cambridge on Tuesday, I need to see MIT to survive till the rest of the term.
Angelina Jolie is very beautiful!!!....
yea i love mit, and i really dk why.
oh! Traffic in Seattle sucks!
That's why I most love the Harvard story:
I love UCLA but miss everyone from back home.
PARIS HILTON SUCKS!
Tough game to pick, but I'll take Seattle at home with the mobile QB and Matt Morris against a pitiful St. Louis run defense.
Anyway, some crappy Honda, but, as is young peoples'customs, it has a good $ 2 million worth of sound equipment inside.
, sticking a nerf football on lennon's ugly toyota, kissing the audi, ummm...
i love you my harvard boy..(
I also love the new rabbits, I still want an x-terra-but Luke's will do, and I kinda like Honda Elements, but they got a bad safety rating: (..
Oh my god I LOVE Pommes mit Mayo.
i love angelina jolie.
I know you're way too smart and way too cool to let stupid UCLA get to you...
I'm not crazy about HK either, but Shanghai is sounding awesome.
I love the Toyota Prius.
我還在用that stupid BOX CAR-HONDA CRX = o = 。 CRAP GAME!..
I hate Paris Hilton..
AAA's " Q " is catchy and an ear worm, like many of the things they've done.
I need to pay Geico and a host of other bills but that is neither here nor there.
Shanghai is beautiful ~..
And as stupid as San Francisco's road system is, we weren't able to turn back because of how all the roads are one-way streets.
I like Honda...
i love san francisco, driving over the bridge i get so excited for whats to come, i get rush of air each time i go there...
Stupid UCLA....
harvard is dumb, i mean they really have to be stupid to have not wanted her to be at their school.
. I'm pleased to announce that Boston sucked...
I still like Tom Cruise.
The seattle scene is pretty amazing too....
Before I left Missouri, I thought London was going to be so good and cool and fun and a really great experience and I was really excited.
I think Angelina Jolie is so much more beautiful than Jennifer Anniston, who, by the way, is majorly OVERRATED.
london sucks....
I was rejected by the stupid San Francisco literary agency that I sent my manuscript to.
Mit humør sucks for tiden, har super mange lektier, og jeg nyser hele tiden, min næse er helt tilstoppet, og mit hovede føles tungt..
i love seattle..
I love the London Little People, btw.
mastercard is stupid.
I hate Paris Hilton..

I'd like to talk today about how much I hate Paris Hilton.....
I love MIT so much...

Today, Hillary Clinton is lambasted in an extremely vulgar fashion by a World leader:
Then we had stupid trivia about San Francisco and sci fi tv so we left...
I needed San Francisco but not until a month ago."""
